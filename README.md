# Structura
Reworks the weapon/tech system a bit, by allowing to partially invest into weapons and then do the full commit later, so u dont need as much storage.
You can build multiple weapon foundations, which do not require tech to be converted into a weapon, so u can build some and maybe sell the tech for a better rush.

Currently supports Devices for structures, but this demo doesnt use them.
The structure can be detected in its mirrored form, so u can build weapins facing both directions
The build option for the structure builds on earlier progress and attempts to complete it.
If a structure check fails, you initially get 75% back, but only 50% if it fails during conversion.
All laser weaponry uses the same structure, while cannon weapons each use a different structure, which makes it easier to understand and test/play for now.
